Multitool will eventually be packed with forms for WordPress administrators.
                        
== Description ==

Multitool will offer an endless range of forms that do a wide range of tasks. I plan to
put a bit of every plugin I make into this one plugin. It means a single plugin can be installed
to cover many needs.

Users will have the ability to not only disable but delete sections (actual files) and tools
that are no required. A profile will be saved so that on updating the plugin
it will automatically remove files that are no required. It will also disable automation and prevent 
loading certain classes. It essentially shrinks
the size of the plugin package, simplifies the interface and becomes a customized
plugin on a per user basis. This is another innovative experiment that needs your backing.

Yes you can pay the plugin author to improve the plugin to suit your needs. Many improvements will be done free so
post your requirements on the plugins forum first.

= When To Update = 

Browse the changes log and decide if an update is required. There is nothing wrong with skipping version if it does not
help you - look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want
to avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version - do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation 
(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different
environment for WTG Task Manager - possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common
in software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the Multitool plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
